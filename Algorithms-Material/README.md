# Steps to learn algorithms ⚙️

## Learn the basics

1. Why it is used?/What it replaces?
1. Mathematical equations 
1. Graphs/plots; why the graphs are how they are, significance and be curious and hypothesise what will happen with different different datasets
1. How it learns
1. What are its weights and baises
2. How its is affected by imabalanced and skewed datasets and how the algorithm handles outliers

## Implementation
1. Load a toy dataset from `sklearn.datasets` 
1. Don't augment or spend time on the dataset as it is a toy dataset, our goal is to learn how the implementation works
2. Learn how the model object accepts the data i.e size, shape, classes etc...
3. Read docs, learn about the parameters
4. How to evaluate the model i.e learn scoring metrics which come under that specific model and learn how `.predict()` will work for that model object
5. Learn how to pickle and save the model as binary

# Deeper dive

1. Go to [SCISPACE](https://typeset.io/)
2. Get a famous research paper about that algorithm
3. Upload that paper to SCISPACE, it has a chat bot specifically for research paper
4. Read and ask questions if any to the bot
5. Try to the understand significance of every formula and every statement
6. Learn the real life/best use cases
