# Procedure To Perform EDA
1. **Understanding the Problem Statement**: Understand the problem or question you are trying to solve or answer with the dataset.

2. **Data Collection**: Collect the data that you think might help you in solving the problem or answering the question.

3. **Data Cleaning**:
    - Handle missing values.
    - Remove duplicates.
    - Filter out outliers.
    - Correct inconsistent data types.

4. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Feature scaling: Standardize or normalize numerical features if necessary.
    - Encoding: Convert categorical variables into numerical variables.
    - Feature engineering: Create new features from existing ones if necessary.

5. **Data Visualization**: Use plots and charts to understand patterns, relationships, and outliers in the data. Some commonly used plots are:
    - Histograms
    - Box plots
    - Scatter plots
    - Correlation matrix

6. **Statistical Analysis**: Perform statistical tests to validate your findings. This could include:
    - Hypothesis testing
    - Checking distributions
    - Analyzing variance

7. **Insights and Recommendations**: Based on your EDA, provide insights and recommendations.
